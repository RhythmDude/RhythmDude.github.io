This is a website for me to test various API's of modern websites but in an website possible to be ran on ancient safari (~2010) on an iPod Touch Second Generation. (hence the name.)
Of course, either way it will always work on the same or newer (heck, even older) safari versions, depsite being an Ipod touch 2G, 1G, iphone 2G, 3G, etc. Thats jsut the name because its the device im testing with.
I want to either make a) A reddit client b) a youtube client (ðŸ˜¬) c) a tiktok client (ðŸ˜¬ again)
I have limited html and css, little javascript, so atleast anything i make can work with ancient safari.
This is a very ambitious project, so for now it will just be testing grounds (The extent of java interaction, compatability with modern libraries, etc.) until i decide on A, B, or C.
